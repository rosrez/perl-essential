This page describes the syntax of regular expressions in Perl.

If you haven't used regular expressions before, a quick-start introduction
is available in perlrequick, and a longer tutorial introduction is
available in perlretut.

For reference on how regular expressions are used in matching operations,
plus various examples of the same, see discussions of "m//", "s///",
"qr//" and "??" in "Regexp Quote-Like Operators" in perlop.

New in v5.22, "use re 'strict'" applies stricter rules than otherwise when
compiling regular expression patterns. It can find things that, while
legal, may not be what you intended.
